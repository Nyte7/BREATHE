# BREATHE

This is a re-usable exhalation valve meant to be retrofitted to non-valve equipped N95 masks or surgical masks.
These were printed using a Creality CR-10 V2 printer with a 0.6mm nozzle.  It has been tested with 3M N95 and Benethal N95 masks.

You will need to cut out a 3cm x 3cm circular gasket with a tiny 1mm hole in the middle.  The gasket is placed into the bottom piece and is held in place by the tiny 1mm rod.  The
gasket can be cut from either a balloon, a thin rubber sheet, a thin silicone sheet, or a thin latex sheet (from a medical glove).

To retrofit an existing mask:

1. Simply cut out a circular hole on the side of your mask that is 3.5cm x 3.5cm.
2. Place the bottom piece (the one with the spokes) on the inside of the mask through the hole.
3. Attach the top cover piece and rotate clockwise to lock it in place.
4. Prior to disposing your mask, you can remove the valve by rotating the top piece counter-clockwise.  It can be rinsed or sanitized with alcohol if need be.
