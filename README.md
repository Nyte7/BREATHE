# BREATHE

This is a re-usable exhalation valve meant to be retrofitted to non-valve equipped N95 masks or surgical masks.
These were printed using a Creality CR-10 V2 printer with a 0.6mm nozzle.  It has been tested with 3M N95, McCordDick N95, and Benethal N95 masks.

To retrofit an existing mask:

1. Simply cut out a circular hole on the side of your mask that is 3.4cm in diameter.  It's better to start smaller and then gradually cut bigger until the BOTTOM shell part fits snugly (step 2).
2. Place the bottom piece (the one with the spokes) on the inside of the mask through the hole.
3. Attach the top cover piece and rotate clockwise to lock it in place.
4. Prior to disposing your mask, you can remove the valve by rotating the top piece counter-clockwise.  It can be rinsed or sanitized with alcohol or soap/water if need be.

For the gasket material (or inner diaphragm), you can use a TPE rubber sheet that is 1/32 inch or thinner.  It should be cut 3.1cm in diameter.  A tiny hole is then poked in the center of the diaphragm.  The diaphragm is then inserted over the peg in the bottem shell part all the way down and pressed against it so that it remains as flat as possible.

The valve gets tighter as it is rotated to accompany most respirator materials (from thick N95 masks to thin surgical masks).  Don't over-tighten as it may snap.
